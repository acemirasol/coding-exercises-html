                <li>Cook spaghetti noodles as per package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large pot, add oil and butter and cook over medium heat until butter is melted. Once melted, add garlic and onions and cook until tender and fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add ground beef and cook while stirring and breaking the lumps until it is no longer pink, about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the hotdogs and cook for 2 minutes while stirring and turning them from time to time.</li>
                <li>Stir in the corned beef and cook for 1 minute. Add the carrots, bell peppers, and mushrooms. Cook for a minute while stirring to combine.</li>
                <li>Pour in the tomato sauce and banana ketchup and season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 5-7 minutes or until the carrots are cooked. You may add a half cup of water if the sauce is getting too thick.</li>
                <li>Grate half of the block of the cheese on top of the sauce and cook for another 1-2 minutes while stirring to melt the cheese completely.</li>
                <li>Add the cooked spaghetti noodles and toss until completely covered in sauce. Transfer to a serving plate and add more grated cheese on top.</li>
